            After I was honorably discharged, I went on to complete my education with an A.A. in Administration of Justice and a B.A. in English. I had 
            moved onto Law Enforcement, but after realizing it was not for me, I went on to banking. 
            I became a Personal Banker, then a Mortgage Loan Closer. 
            I was given an opportunity to then become a Technical Recruiting Sourcer for amn A.I. driven recruiting platform. This sparked an interest
